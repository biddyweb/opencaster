=============================

How to compile and install:
The procedure is tested on a Debian Stable Linux x86 32bit architecture, that's our envirorment.
Packages usually required but not installed on the Stable are: python-dev, libpcap-dev and zlib1g-dev, there are development libraries needed to compile OpenCaster.
N.B. Python version should be 2.4, even minor numbers like 2.3 or 2.5 brings quite important differences, just type "python" and check version number.
To build the package you need to type "make" into OpenCaster directory.
To install the tools you need to type "make install" with root privileges.
