OpenCaster 1.0 30/6/2008

Lorenzo Pallara (l.pallara@avalpa.com)

Known bugs:
tools/tstdt: is it necessary to change section version? it doesn't but some boxes seem to complain
tools/tsmodder: to manage small bit rate shouldn't use tsloop
tools/tsloop: loop functionalties need be factorized and put as a library, null packet also
tools/ip2sec: there are compatibility problems with recent libpcap
tools/esvideo2pes: uses a fixed GOP, can be rewritten to manage dynamically changing GOP, that's actually not good for CBRness

Change log OpenCaster 1.0:
